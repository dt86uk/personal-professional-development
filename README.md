# personal-professional-development

This is a .NET Razor Pages application designed to assist with the tracking of Personal Professional Development.

To get started, download the repository and navigate to the JSON file in the Repository/Goals folder. Add a 'Mission Statement' - what you want your main accomplishment to be - and from there you can break your mission statement into Goals which then have a sub set of Actions. For example a Goal could be "Learn ReactJs" and there are Actions you can take in order to achieve this Goal. An Action could be "Complete a PluralSight course on ReactJs" and so forth.

Structure:
- Mission Statement (Parent)
- - GoalsMe
- - - Actions
- - GoalsBoss
- - - Actions
